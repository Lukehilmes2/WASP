#WASP
##WAGER on SPORTS
The goal of this app is to allow users to find an upcoming sports
game and wager an amount of money with another user that is dependent
on the outcome of the game that was chosen.

This repository contains typescript, json, css, and html files
which make up the WASP app. This project implements 
Ionic Framework for user interface, NodeJS, Angular JS, 
and AngularFire to connect to the database, and firebase
as the actual database.
